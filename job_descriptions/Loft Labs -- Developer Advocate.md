About Loft Labs

We are a venture-backed tech startup striving to be the leading force in enabling platform engineers. After closing our Series A lead by Khosla Ventures in Q1 2024, we are in the hyper-growth phase and looking for motivated people to complement our team. Our headquarters are in San Francisco (Salesforce Tower), but our team is distributed around the globe, and we have a remote-first work culture.

We're the company behind vCluster, an open-source technology for virtualizing Kubernetes (+40M virtual clusters created by users, vibrant Slack community with +3,000 members, +5k GitHub stars).

The adoption of our commercial product based on vCluster has grown extremely fast (multi-million dollar revenue, 4.6x ARR growth over the past 12 months), and our customer base now includes some of the biggest companies in the world including 6 Global Fortune 500 companies as well as some of the fastest-growing tech unicorns.

Working on developer tools and open-source technology is part of our DNA.

We are the maintainers of several popular open-source projects, including:

- vCluster - Virtual Kubernetes Clusters, a certified Kubernetes distribution with 40M+ downloads: www.vcluster.com
- DevPod - Codespaces but open-source, client-only, unopinionated was #1 on HackerNews twice after launch, +8,000 GitHub stars: www.devpod.sh
- DevSpace - CNCF Sandbox Project, 4,000+ GitHub stars: www.devspace.sh

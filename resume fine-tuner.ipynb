    "\n",
    "- **An OpenAI account.** You can sign up for one at the [OpenAI Platform page](https://platform.openai.com/).\n",

It's named after the temperature parameter in statistical physics, where higher temperatures lead to more disorder. It’s essentially a \"creativity dial\" that lets developers or users control how much the LLM sticks to the most likely responses versus exploring more varied possibilities. In most LLMs, this is a value between 0 and 2, and the default value is 1.\n",

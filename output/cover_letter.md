Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Developer Advocate - Technical Storytelling position at Datadog. With over a decade of experience in software development and a strong passion for technical storytelling, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to leverage my engineering expertise and creative communication skills to help Datadog engage its community effectively.

In reviewing the job description, I was particularly drawn to the emphasis on driving the execution of technical event content programs. Having spearheaded the creation and presentation of technical materials for major events such as the Oktane conference while at Okta, I successfully translated complex security technologies into compelling narratives that resonated with diverse audiences. My work increased readership for the Auth0 Developer Blog from zero to 20,000 views monthly, showcasing my ability to create content that captures attention and engages technical audiences.

Additionally, I have extensive experience partnering with engineering teams—both internally and externally—to coach them on effective public communication. As a Developer Advocate at Okta, I developed mobile quickstart kits designed to enhance developer engagement, utilizing expert storytelling to make the technology accessible. Furthermore, I delivered high-impact presentations at various tech events, such as Civo Navigate Local Tampa, where I emphasized the importance of effective storytelling in technical communication.

Datadog’s commitment to fostering a collaborative community aligns with my professional ethos as I believe in empowering others through clear communication and mentoring. My background in both technology and education, illustrated through my work as a Python/AI instructor, equips me with the knowledge and experience needed to partner with internal product teams and coach them in presenting their work authentically. I thrive in environments that value creativity and collaboration—qualities that I understand are fundamental at Datadog.

I am eager to bring my unique blend of technical acumen and storytelling expertise to the Senior Developer Advocate role at Datadog. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience aligns with Datadog’s mission to provide innovative solutions that meet the needs of your customers. Thank you for considering my application. I hope to speak with you soon.

Warm regards,

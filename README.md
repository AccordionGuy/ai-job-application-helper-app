# AI Job Application Helper App

This is a Juypter Notebook created for the Tampa Bay AI Meetup session on Monday, March 17, 2025, where we presented the audience with an application that takes the following...

- The user’s résumé in Markdown format
- A job description

...and generates a new résumé that’s fine-tuned to better match the job description.


## Installation

To run this Jupyter Notebook, you need:

- Python (version 3.8 or later)
- Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, or some other environment capable running Jupyter Notebooks

Run the Notebook file — `resume fine-tuner.ipynb` —  by opening it in your Jupyter Notebook-running environment and run each cell.

# AI Job Application Helper App

![](./images/build_ai_job_application_helper_app.png)

This is a Juypter Notebook created for the Tampa Bay AI Meetup session on Monday, March 17, 2025, where we presented the audience with an application that takes the following...

- The user’s résumé in Markdown format
- A job description

...and generates a new résumé and cover letter that’s fine-tuned to better match the job description.


## Installation

To run this Jupyter Notebook, you need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or later)
- [Jupyter Lab/Notebook(https://jupyter.org/)] or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Jupyter plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) installed. 

Run the Notebook file — `resume fine-tuner.ipynb` —  by opening it in your Jupyter Notebook-running environment and run each cell.
